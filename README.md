## BDD
|BEHAVIOUR                         INPUT                                        | OUTPUT
|---------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------:|-----------------------
| all sides equal | side a == side b && side b == side c  && side a == side c | equilaterl triangle|
|two sides of the triangle are equal | side a==side b && side b! == side c | isoceless |
| all sides are unequal | side a!==side b && side b!==side c | scalene |
## How it works.
1.	the triangle-triacker will ask you to entre the measurements of the three sides of your tiangle,

--if all the sides are equal, it will alert you "this is an equilateral triangle" 

--if two of the sides are equal and one is diffrent fron the resst it will alert you "this is an isoceless triangle"

--if the sum of any two triangles are greater than the third side , or if all the sides dont match it will alert you "this is a scalene triangle" 

--lastley if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then it will alertyou "a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values." 

2.it has a button by the name "submit" where you submit your questions and it will help you find your answer of which type of triangle it is
